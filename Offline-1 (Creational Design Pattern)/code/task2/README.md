**Problem 2:**

You are tasked with designing a system for a bank that offers multiple services. For now, we are considering two major operations: loan and savings account operations. The bank has three customer types: Regular, Premium and VIP. The payment schemes and interest types vary based on the customer type. The interest rates for different customers are shown in the following table.



<table><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="top">Operation</th><th colspan="3" valign="top">Interest rate</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" valign="top">Regular</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">Premium</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">VIP</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" valign="top">Accounts</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">2.5%</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">3.5%</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">5%</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" valign="top">Loan</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">14%</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">12%</td><td colspan="1" valign="top">10%</td></tr>
</table>

**Tasks:**

- Identify the design pattern(s) that can best capture the scenario.
- Implement the appropriate classes. The loan and account classes must contain functions that calculate the total interest given a certain period of time. You may use simple or compound interest formulas.
- A simple demonstration showing a user utilizing these functionalities would suffice.
