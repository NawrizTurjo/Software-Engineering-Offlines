# Online on Creational Pattern

## Time: 30 minutes

You are developing a meal-ordering system for a restaurant that offers customizable meal packages. Each meal package consists of a **main course**, **side dish**, **drink**, and optionally a **dessert**. The system should allow customers to build their own meal by selecting different components. New items can be added to the menu in the future without changing the existing structure of the meal.

You need to implement a builder that allows the construction of different meal combinations. The system should be able to create standard meals (e.g., a **Vegetarian Meal**, a **Non-Vegetarian Meal**) as well as fully customized meal orders.

Your task is to design the system using the builder pattern to construct various meal combinations with minimal changes needed when new meal components are added.
