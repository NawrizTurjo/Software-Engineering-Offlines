## Online on Creational Pattern

**Time: 25 minutes**

You are developing a vehicle booking system for a ride-hailing service. The system needs to support multiple types of vehicles such as ***Sedan***, ***SUV***, and ***Motorbike***. As the company expands, it may add new vehicle types (e.g., ***Electric Cars*** or ***Bicycles***) without affecting the current system.

You need to implement a vehicle *interface* where users can select their preferred vehicle type and initiate a booking. The classes that represent the vehicles will have a function to handle the booking process and confirm the booking.

Your task is to design the system so that adding new vehicle types in the future requires minimal changes to the existing codebase.
