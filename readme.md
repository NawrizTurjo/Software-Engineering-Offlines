# CSE-214 Software Engineering Sessional

Welcome to the **CSE-214 Software Engineering Sessional** repository. This repository is dedicated to solving and demonstrating various **Design Patterns** in Java. Each folder contains solutions to problems based on specific categories of design patterns, complete with examples and explanations.

## Design Patterns Covered

### 1. Creational Patterns  
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms to improve flexibility and reuse in your designs:  
- **[Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)**  
- **[Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)**  
- **[Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)**  
- **[Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)**  

### 2. Structural Patterns  
Structural patterns deal with object composition to ensure better system structure and flexibility:  
- **[Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)**  
- **[Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)**  
- **[Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)**  
- **[Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)**  

### 3. Behavioral Patterns  
Behavioral patterns focus on the communication and interaction between objects:  
- **[State](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)**  
- **[Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)**  
- **[Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)**  
- **[Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)**  
- **[Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility)**
